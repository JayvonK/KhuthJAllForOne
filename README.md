Project - All For One
For this project I used my past api endpoints and combined them together to make a an 11 page website that accesses all of my past endpoints. When creating the project, I first started off by creating a figma, then I hosted an azure api that held all my past endpoints. After that I began coding, where I used only tailwind for styling, and java script for all my functions and button clicks. After all that, it was mainly copy and pasting, because most pages were similar.
