Project - All For One
For this project I used my past api endpoints and combined them together to make a an 11 page website that accesses all of my past endpoints. When creating the project, I first started off by creating a figma, then I hosted an azure api that held all my past endpoints. After that I began coding, where I used only tailwind for styling, and java script for all my functions and button clicks. After all that, it was mainly copy and pasting, because most pages were similar.

Peer Review: Flawless. The website looks exactly like the figma and is completely functional. I like extra attention to detail with "playing again" and all the button hover effects. The website is resposnive and it was very smart to make the page similar to each other. Great work as always!
